# Collaboration Practice Repository

This repository was created by me and my friend as a learning project to experiment with the core concepts of collaborative GitHub workflows.

## Purpose

- To understand how to **add collaborators** to a repository.
- To practice creating **feature branches** for working on separate tasks.
- To learn how collaborators can **create branches**, **commit changes**, and **push** to the repo.
- To get hands-on experience with creating **pull requests (PRs)**.
- To understand the process of how the **repository owner reviews and merges PRs**.

This repo is a sandbox for experimenting with the typical collaborative development cycle used in real-world projects.

---

## Workflow Overview

1. **Collaborator** creates a new branch to work on a feature or fix.
2. Changes are committed and pushed to the collaboratorâ€™s branch.
3. Collaborator opens a **pull request** for review.
4. Repository **owner reviews** the PR, discusses if needed, and merges it when ready.
5. Branches can then be deleted after merging to keep the repository clean.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and learn how collaborative software development works with Git and GitHub!
